Description: Stability assessment evaluates the consistency of statistical
    inferences when subject to minor and inconsequential changes in data or the
    statistical model. Such changes should only result in minor variations to
    parameter estimates, standard errors, confidence intervals, and other
    statistical outputs that underpin the inferences. The 'gifistab' package is
    designed for performing stability assessments as a component of statistical
    analysis. This package draws on the framework proposed by Michailides and
    de Leeuw (1998) <https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0789f7d3>, encompassing seven
    types of stability assessments: replication stability, statistical stability,
    stability under data selection, stability under model selection, numerical
    stability, analytic and algebraic stability, and stability under the selection
    of technique. The stability_assessment() function in 'gifistab' conducts a
    stability assessment following the outlined framework, while the
    stability_app() function facilitates interactive stability assessments
    through a web application built with 'shiny'.
