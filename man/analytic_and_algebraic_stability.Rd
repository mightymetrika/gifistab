\title{Analytic and Algebraic Stability Assessment}
\usage{
analytic_and_algebraic_stability(model, warn = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A fitted model object, either of class \code{lm} or \code{glm}.}

\item{warn}{Logical. If TRUE (default), warnings are printed when the condition
number indicates severe multicollinearity (i.e., > 30).}

\item{...}{Other parameters to be passed to the \code{kappa} function.}
}
\value{
A list with the L1 norm and Linf norm condition numbers.
}
\description{
This function assesses the analytic and algebraic stability of a fitted model
by calculating two condition numbers (kappa): one based on the L1 norm and
another based on the Linf norm of the model matrix.
